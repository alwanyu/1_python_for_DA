## Univariate Analysis
Univariate analysis examines one variable at a time. It focuses on the distribution, central tendency, and dispersion of a single feature without 
considering relationships with other variables.

**Examples:**
- Histograms showing the distribution of ages
- Box plots of income values
- Summary statistics (mean, median, mode) of a single variable
- Frequency tables of categorical data


## Bivariate Analysis
Bivariate analysis examines the relationship between two variables to determine if there are associations or correlations between them.

**Examples:**
- Scatter plots showing the relationship between height and weight
- Correlation coefficients between price and square footage
- Cross-tabulations between gender and product preference
- Line graphs showing changes in two variables over time

## Multivariate Analysis
Multivariate analysis examines three or more variables simultaneously to understand complex interactions and relationships within the data.

**Examples:**
- Multiple regression models with several predictors
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Cluster analysis using multiple features
- Heat maps showing correlations among many variables

## Feature Exploration
Feature exploration is the process of investigating and understanding the characteristics of variables in your dataset. It involves:

1. **Data profiling**: Examining data types, missing values, and basic statistics
2. **Distribution analysis**: Understanding how values are distributed
3. **Outlier detection**: Identifying unusual observations
4. **Relationship discovery**: Finding connections between features
5. **Feature importance**: Determining which variables have the most impact
6. **Feature engineering**: Creating new variables from existing ones to improve model performance

Feature exploration is typically performed early in the data analysis process to guide subsequent modeling decisions and to gain insights about the underlying data structure.

## Correlation

Correlation measures the statistical relationship between two variables - specifically how they change together. It indicates both the strength 
and direction of the relationship.

**Key aspects of correlation:**

- **Correlation coefficient**: Typically ranges from -1 to +1
  - +1 indicates perfect positive correlation (as one variable increases, the other increases proportionally)
  - 0 indicates no correlation (variables move independently)
  - -1 indicates perfect negative correlation (as one variable increases, the other decreases proportionally)

- **Types of correlation measures:**
  - Pearson correlation: Measures linear relationships
  - Spearman correlation: Measures monotonic relationships (direction matters, not magnitude)
  - Kendall's tau: Another rank correlation measure, robust to outliers

- **Important considerations:**
  - Correlation does not imply causation
  - Correlation only captures linear or monotonic relationships
  - Outliers can significantly impact correlation values

## Trend Detection

Trend detection involves identifying patterns, consistent behaviors, or directions in data, particularly in time series data.

**Key aspects of trend detection:**

- **Types of trends:**
  - Upward/downward trends: Consistent increase or decrease over time
  - Cyclical trends: Patterns that repeat over non-fixed intervals
  - Seasonal trends: Patterns that repeat at fixed intervals (daily, weekly, yearly)
  - Random fluctuations: No discernible pattern

- **Trend detection methods:**
  - Moving averages: Smoothing data to reveal underlying trends
  - Regression analysis: Fitting lines or curves to identify direction
  - Decomposition: Separating time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components
  - Mann-Kendall test: Statistical test for monotonic trends in time series

- **Applications:**
  - Market analysis and forecasting
  - Climate data analysis
  - Social media sentiment tracking
  - Disease outbreak monitoring
  - Economic indicator analysis

Both correlation analysis and trend detection are fundamental techniques in exploratory data analysis that help analysts understand relationships and patterns in data before building predictive models.
